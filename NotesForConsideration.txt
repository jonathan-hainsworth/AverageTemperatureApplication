For consideration.

1. Throttling
Application to use API key to distinguish users however throttling is an option where a queue based pattern where requests are stored and processed at a given rate.
PRO - This approach does not reply on an API key to identify user (that the governance of has not been implemented).
CON - This would throttle requests for all users not just individuals

2. Asynchronous Method 
PRO - High Availability: Asynchronous Method, runs in a thread separate from the main application thread freeing up the main thread.

3. Scope of Injected Dependencies
PRO - High Availability: Declaring the scope of the injected dependencies so that they are created as they are required.

4. Caching to database 
CON - data could be cached to memory, so that there is no dependency on database being avalible.
PRO - if application is restarted cached data is not lost.
