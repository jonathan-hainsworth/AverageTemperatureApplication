1. Throttling
Application to use API key to distinguish users however throttling is an option where a queue based pattern where requests are stored and processed at a given rate.
PRO - This approach does not reply on an API key to identify user (that the governance of has not been implemented).
CON - This would throttle requests for all users not just individuals
